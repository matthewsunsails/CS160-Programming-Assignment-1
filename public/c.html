          You're not supposed to be here! If you somehow managed to get here,
          you did so by typing "/c" into that URL bar at the top of your browser.
          Crafty one, ain'tcha? Well, I respect it. A rabbit, for your efforts. And,
          frankly, for your troubles.

        <p>
          ... You should probably leave, though.

      <footer>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          No, seriously, why? Was it a morbid curiosity? You saw the URL for the other two sites
          were "/a" and "/b" and decided to try out "/c", didn't you? Well, I've got you now!
          ... is what I would say, if I was evil. You're lucky I didn't put some analog horror image
          in place of this rabbit (who is very cute, of course). Well, I hope you've had fun reading
          my inane spewing of nonsense. Enjoy the rest of your day, now.
