  <head>
    <!-- put your links to external stylesheets or external javascript files (whether

  <body>
    anything you want to visually show up on this webpage should be put in here,
    like
    <p>paragraphs,</p>
    <input type="button" id="mycoolbutton" value="a cool button!" />
    <div>and all other page content.</div>
  </body>

  <script>
    //javascript can go in here. this is where I prefer to put it if it's going to be short and simple.

    document.getElementById("mycoolbutton").onclick = () => {
      console.log("button clicked!");
    };
  </script>
</html>
